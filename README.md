# PRICE-PREDICTION-ANALYSIS--BENGALURU-HOUSE

Project Objective
To predict house prices in Bengaluru using machine learning models and deliver actionable business insights through data visualization and storytelling in Tableau.


Approach & Framework
Framework Used: OSEMN (Obtain, Scrub, Explore, Model, iNterpret)
Obtain: Collected real Bengaluru house sales data.
Scrub: Cleaned data, handled missing values, outliers, feature engineering.
Explore: Performed exploratory analysis to uncover market trends and patterns.
Model: Built regression models (Random Forest, Linear Regression) to predict prices.
iNterpret: Extracted business insights and recommendations using Tableau visualizations.


SMART Goal
Specific: Predict housing prices based on location, size, and features.
Measurable: Achieve RMSE < ₹1 crore on test data.
Achievable: Used robust preprocessing and advanced models.
Relevant: Supports homebuyers, sellers, investors, and realtors in Bengaluru.
Time-bound: Completed within a 2-hour timeframe.


Key Findings & Insights
Price distribution is highly skewed, with luxury outliers. Most homes are priced affordably, but some high-end properties drive up the average.
Locality matters: Premium areas like Indira Nagar and Whitefield command significantly higher prices, while emerging localities offer better value-for-money.
BHK mix varies by location: Urban hubs are dominated by compact (1–2 BHK) units; suburbs favor larger homes (3+ BHK).
Price per sqft is a key value metric: Some localities have high overall prices but offer better value when considering price per sqft.
The predictive model is highly accurate for standard properties; outliers and luxury homes show higher prediction error.


Business Recommendations
For Buyers: Focus on median prices and price per sqft for smart property selection.
For Investors: Target high-growth and undervalued localities; monitor price trends per sqft.
For Developers/Realtors: Align housing inventory and marketing with local demand patterns (BHK mix, price range).
For Data Teams: Regularly update the model with new data for ongoing accuracy.


Deliverables
1. Cleaned and model-ready dataset for analysis and Tableau.
2. Tableau dashboard/story providing interactive insights on Bengaluru's housing market.
3. Business interpretation document summarizing actionable recommendations for all market participants.
